# Audio Plugin - Chord and Voicing Generator

## Overview
This is an audio plugin built with JUCE that creates chords and voicings based on emotions and other musical controls. The plugin helps musicians and producers generate musically appropriate chord progressions and voicings that match specific emotional contexts.

## Key Components

### State.h
The `State.h` file contains the main state management class where all plugin state should be saved. This includes:
- Current key selection
- Emotional parameters
- Chord progression settings
- Voicing preferences
- Any other persistent plugin parameters

All state that needs to be saved/loaded with the plugin session should be managed through this class.

### KeyManager
The `KeyManager` class is responsible for music theory functionality:
- Managing all 12 musical keys
- Providing notes that belong to a selected key
- Generating chords within a key
- Handling scale degrees and chord progressions
- Supporting different modes and scales

The KeyManager serves as the core music theory engine that other components can query for musically correct note and chord information.

## Plugin Architecture
- **Emotional Controls**: Parameters that influence the mood and character of generated chords
- **Key Selection**: Choose from all 12 musical keys
- **Chord Generation**: Create chords and voicings based on selected key and emotional parameters
- **State Management**: Persistent storage of all plugin parameters through the State class

## Development Notes
- Built using JUCE framework
- Follows standard audio plugin architecture
- State management centralized in State.h
- Music theory logic encapsulated in KeyManager
- UI components interact with both State and KeyManager for functionality
